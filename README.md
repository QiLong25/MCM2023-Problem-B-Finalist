## Abstract
How to balance the development of economy and the protection of wildlife in Maasai Mara has been a focus of global concern for a long time. The wildlife quantity has declined sharply in the past ten years. Worse still local economy has been negatively influenced by conflict between local people and wildlife and the covid 19 epidemic. Adjusting policy and management of Maasai Mara is extremely urgent. 

For the first task, we sperate the preserve and its surrounding area into nine regions according to their landscapes, rainfall, etc. Digging into historical causes to the current condition, based on real world data including tourist quantity and local animal husbandry features, revealing linearity of relation between rainfall and farming income factor , predicting tourist quantity in 2023, and distribution of accommodation, we manage to establish a **discrete model** to assess farming efficiency, predict tourist quantity, and predict consequent interaction between wildlife and human. With such indexes, specific policies and strategies are proposed, i.e., several recommended allocations of industrial land use. 

For the second task, an **interaction quantification model** using data fitting is proposed. By analyzing the relationships among data, we concluded that wildlife density is influenced by both human density and livestock density, which reflect the pattern of interaction between them. Besides, a **multi-objective optimization model** is established. The objective function takes both economy and ecosystem into account, and **Genetic Algorithm** is adopted to obtain the best combinations of variables. The best policy and strategy turn out varying in different regions, which indicates that a re-allocation of land used for agriculture, animal husbandry and tourism can indeed reach a better balance between the locals’ interests and wildlife protection. For example, an optimal land use management for one of the subregions near Maasai Mara National Reserve, which we name as CSV2, allocates 83.08% of its total area for tourism, 8.26% for agriculture, and 8.66% for animal husbandry. Meanwhile, another region, TM3, allocates 70.94% for agriculture, 7.11% for animal husbandry, and 21.95% for tourism, which fits our intuitive conjecture based on farming efficiency and distance to National Preserve well. 

For the third task, a prediction for long-term trend of the preserve with our strategy is offered first. By coarse analysis, a potential profit of 3 × 107 dollars can be attained by progressively adjusting the land utilization according to our strategy. Since parameters can be adjusted according to associating features of different areas, our methodology is proved powerful enough to be applied for better development of other natural reserves as well.
